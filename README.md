# pharma-dashboard
Demonstrates Python data engineering, Dash app development, and domain expertise in pharma process automation.


## 📊 What It Does

- Simulates a dummy pharmaceutical process to generate batch records and alarm events.
- Stores data as CSV files (planned migration to SQLite for SQL practice).
- Uses pandas for data cleaning and transformations.
- Serves interactive plots and tables through a web dashboard using Dash and Plotly.
- Demonstrates how my pharma automation experience translates to modern data engineering and web development skills.
- camelCase used in place of snake_case for experience
